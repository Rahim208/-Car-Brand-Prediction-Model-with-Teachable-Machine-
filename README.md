As a beginner in machine learning, I’m thrilled to share my first project where I used Google’s Teachable Machine to train a model that identifies car brands from seven different companies. This project is a part of my learning journey, and it’s been incredibly rewarding to see the model learn to recognize each brand’s unique features!
 What I Learned:
 How to train a model by feeding it sample data from different car brands
 The basics of machine learning and seeing how a model “learns” patterns over time.
 The importance of patience and persistence as I troubleshoot and refine my work.
I’ve included some screenshots to show my progress so far. This project gave me real hands-on experience and a boost of confidence to keep exploring machine learning. If you’re also a beginner in tech or have tips to share, I’d love to connect and learn together!
